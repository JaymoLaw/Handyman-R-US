    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 28px;">Handyman-R-Us | NYC</h1>

    <img src="https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4Dukjb672Ig56NDGFDRZeQ/o.jpg" alt="Handyman-R-Us Logo" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 250px; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc;" />

    <p>Handyman-R-Us, serving various neighborhoods in New York City, currently holds a 2.9-star rating from 98 reviews. While they market themselves as a reliable one-stop shop for home repairs, customer experiences suggest otherwise. Many clients have expressed frustration over late arrivals, incomplete work, and communication issues. Rondy, a name that appears in multiple reviews, is often described as polite in person but slow to return calls or messages after a job begins. One Manhattan customer said they waited three weeks for a simple drywall patch, only to have it done in under an hour once the crew finally arrived.</p>

    <p>Reports indicate the company often changes pricing mid-project. In one Bronx case, a homeowner received an initial estimate for $400, only to be billed over $700 without prior notice. Others have noted a lack of formal contracts or written agreements, leaving room for disputes over scope and payment. While there are some satisfied customers who praise fast fixes for minor tasks, the negative feedback tends to outweigh the positives for larger jobs requiring consistency and follow-up.</p>

    <p>Another recurring issue is the lack of cleanup after work is completed. Multiple clients reported that dust, debris, and discarded materials were left behind. One Harlem resident claimed their hallway was left with paint splatters and loose screws scattered across the floor. Without a formal quality assurance process, outcomes appear inconsistent. Even so, some reviewers mention quick responses for emergency repairs, suggesting the company may perform better under urgent conditions.</p>

    <p>Rondy has occasionally responded to online criticism, promising improvements, but the overall sentiment remains mixed. Yelp and MapQuest listings reveal a pattern of similar complaints spanning several years. Prospective clients should be prepared to ask detailed questions before hiring and ensure all agreements are documented in writing. In a city with countless repair services, reliability and transparency are essentialâ€”qualities this company has yet to consistently demonstrate.</p>
